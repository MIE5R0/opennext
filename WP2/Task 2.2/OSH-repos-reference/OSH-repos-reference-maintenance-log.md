# OSH project repos reference - selection criteria

The following OSH project selection criteria are derived from Bonvoisin *et al.* (2018) [https://doi.org/10.1017/dsj.2018.15](https://doi.org/10.1017/dsj.2018.15)

1. Discrete manufacturing product. The product is the outcome of discrete manufacturing. Products of food and process industries such as yoghurt, cement, chemicals or plastic compounds are excluded. This criterion is set in order to fit with a design science focus.
2. Tangible and original hardware. The product contains at least in-house, tangible hardware, which includes mechanical or any other type of physical elements (e.g. elecronics, textile). It may eventually include electronic hardware and consequently software. Purely software products, such as Linux are  excluded. In-house means that the piece of hardware is 'original equipment' created by the product originator and not a component bought off the shelf.
3. Complexity.While well-defined metrics assessing product complexity on a positive real scale have been proposed in the scientific literature, using those metrics requires having sucient access to detailed data such as the number of parts. This condition is dicult to satisfy in the context of observation of partly documented and defined products. Therefore, in the following analysis, the complexity of products is evaluated with a rule of thumb: products are considered as complex if they consist of at least two parts of dierent materials. Products such as business card holders or cell phone cases or other 3D-printed gimmicks are out of scope. The objective here is to bring to the foreground those open source products that are on the upper side of the complexity scale and to let aside the myriad of gimmicks that can be found on CAD file exchange platforms such as Thingiverse or Shapeways. This criterion ensures the selection of products which may require the input of more than one person and therefore are potentially the object of collaborative product development processes.
4. Development stage. The product is at least partly defined, i.e., provided with sucient documentation to indicate that the product development maturity is equivalent or above the stage 'system-level design' of the product development process as defined by Ulrich & Eppinger, *Product Design and Development*. Undeveloped product concepts are not considered. This criterion allows delineating the focus from challenge platforms, which focus solely on capturing concepts from external participants. It also ensures that sufficient concrete product-related data could be found.
5. Open source. The product is labelled by its surrounding community as open source. The terms 'open source', 'open source hardware' or 'open hardware' are used in the published documentation as an adjective to qualify either the product or the activities around the product. This is quite a conservative criterion. A non-negligible number of projects adopt principles of OSH without necessarily fitting neatly into this conservative criterion.
