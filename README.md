# opennext

Task management within "Projects" will be used as follows:
  1. add note and convert to issue (title and if needed description)
  2. assign issue to at least one person (person may need to register first...)
  3. assign label - low, medium, high priority
  4. move to correct column - backlog, todo, etc.
  5. if needed, set milestone
  6. use description field for #updates, #details, or #requirements in that order
